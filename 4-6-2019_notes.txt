Today is the first day of my learning journey to become a software developer. I've been the IT field for the pass 11 years. I always wonder that if I am good enough to land a software developer job. Yesterday I woke up and decided that I will start apply for software developer job.

Yesterday, I texted some of my friends and my family to let them know that by 5/1/2020 I will apply for a software developer job. I created 57 weeks plan for studying. I don't want to lay on my bed somedays and wonder was I good enough to be a software developer.

My goal is to create a blog note everydays and aiming to study for 14 hours a week.
