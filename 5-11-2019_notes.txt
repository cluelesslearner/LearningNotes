For the past 5 weeks, I consistently start to program 30 to 1 hours a day.
I temporarily postpone learning on data structure and algorithms and focus on learning web development. My goal is to study or programming at least 1 hour a day. 

For now I want to develop my own blog web application where I can blog about my learning. It's like a notebook for myself.

Somethings I learned last 5 weeks:
   Html
   CSS
   Javascript
   Jquery 
   Boostrap
   Python
   Django web framework
   Git

I had some experience working some of these. For other new topic, I just learn enough of those technology to get me started on my blob web app.

The blog web app details:
  * Frontend: HTML5, Boostrap, Jquery, some javascript
  * Backend: python django web framework
  * Database: PostgreSQL 
  * Hosting: Will be host on ether Salesforce Heroku or AWS E2
  * Version control: git, github
  * Designer tool: dia, sketch
  * Beta release date: 6/1/2019
  * Version 1 date: 7/4/2019
